# Sales-Customer_Analysis
In the landscape of rapidly evolving market conditions, organizations are increasingly reliant on data-driven insights to steer their strategic directions.

By developing interactive dashboards that present a dual perspective—focusing on both sales metrics and customer interactions—this analysis facilitates an enhanced understanding of market dynamics and consumer patterns. The outcomes of this project are expected to guide tactical and strategic decisions, optimizing performance and customer satisfaction.
